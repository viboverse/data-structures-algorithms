# Assignment monitoring 

You should monitor the progress of the assignments yourself by marking them as done and calculating the points for the individual tasks.
* If the task has been successfully completed, mark an `X`.
* If the task has nearly OK completed, mark an `?`. For example, if the test result slightly differs from the correct solution, then it is possible to get also 0.5p or 1-p if the error is tiny.
* otherwise mark `-`

## Self-assessments 

| **Self-assessment** | 
|:-------------------:|
|          -          |

Unfortunately, no points, but an important start in the learning process.

## Attendance (80%)

Mark your attendance here. In this course **80% attendance** is required on the first ten times. 

| **Attendance** | w35 | w36 | w37  | w38 | w39 | w40 | w41 | w43 | w44 | w45 | total |
|:---------------|:---:|:---:|:----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:-----:|
| **Attendance** |  -  |  -  |  -   |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  | 0/10  |    

You track your absences yourself, if you cannot attend class, then you should do the weekly exercises that week.
* Note that **Week 46 is optional** to participate because it is reserved for an optional project that is not mandatory part in this course.
* See **week numbers** for any calendar with week numbers. In the table, **week 35** is marked like **w35**, etc.

## Assignments (max. 24p)

Mark the assignments you have done.
Usually one point per assignment if the answer is correct and the test in assignment or given model answer has not been changed.

#### Assignments 1, 2 and 3

| **Assignment** | 1.1 | 1.2 | 1.3 | 1.4 | 2.1 | 2.2 | 2.3 | 2.4 | 3.1 | 3.2 | 3.3 | 3.4 | total |
|:---------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:-----:|
| **Done**       |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  | 0/12p |

#### Assignments 4, 5 and 6

| **Assignment** | 4.1 | 4.2 | 4.3 | 4.4 | 5.1 | 5.2 | 5.3 | 5.4 | 6.1 | 6.2 | 6.3(2p) | total |
|:---------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:-------:|:-----:|
| **Done**       |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |    -    | 0/8p  |

The teacher gives the final score, but you have to mark your own points clearly yourself.

## Weekly Exercises (max. 6p)

Weekly exercises (see week number like w36 == week 36, etc.). One point if at all weekly exercises are completed. 
If even one is done, you can mark 0.5p.

| **Exercises** | 01 (w36) | 02 (w37) | 03 (w38) | 04 (w39) | 05 (w40) | 06 (w41) | total |
|:--------------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:-----:|
| **Done**      |    -     |    -     |    -     |    -     |    -     |    -     | 0/6p  |

You show activity by doing Weekly exercises. 
It is enough that you think the assignment has been completed almost correctly. 
The return of assignments will be checked at random during the return phase.

## Final Self-assessment (max. 2p)

| **Final Self-assessment** | 
|:-------------------------:|
|             -             |

Remember to return the final self-assessment after completing the course.

## Optional Project (max. 8p)

| **Optional Project** | 
|:--------------------:|
|          -           | 

An optional project which is evaluated by teacher.

## Example 

**Note!** _This is just an example. You can remove this when you understand the idea._

| **Assignment** | 1.1 | 1.2 | 1.3 | 1.4 | 2.1 | 2.2 | 2.3 | 2.4 | total  |
|:---------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:------:|
| **Done**       |  X  |  X  |  X  |  -  |  X  |  ?  |  X  |  X  | 6.5/8p |

Note! Now _teacher_ will evaluate 2.2. 

In this example, you have successfully completed assignments 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 and nearly completed assignment 2.2. 
So the total points you mark are 6.5p of 8p.
