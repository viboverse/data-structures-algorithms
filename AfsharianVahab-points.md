## Self-assessments

| **Self-assessment** |
| :-----------------: |
|          X          |

Unfortunately, no points, but an important start in the learning process.

## Attendance (80%)

Mark your attendance here. In this course **80% attendance** is required on the first ten times.

| **Attendance** | w35 | w36 | w37 | w38 | w39 | w40 | w41 | w43 | w44 | w45 | total |
| :------------- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :---: |
| **Attendance** |  X  |  X  |  X  |  X  |  X  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  | 4/10  |

You track your absences yourself, if you cannot attend class, then you should do the weekly exercises that week.

- Note that **Week 46 is optional** to participate because it is reserved for an optional project that is not mandatory part in this course.
- See **week numbers** for any calendar with week numbers. In the table, **week 35** is marked like **w35**, etc.

## Assignments (max. 24p)

Mark the assignments you have done.

You should monitor the progress of the assignments yourself by marking them as done and calculating the points for the individual tasks.

- If the task has been successfully completed, mark an `X`. The condition is that your answer is correct and the test in assignment has not been modified.
- If the task has nearly OK completed, mark an `?`. For example, if the test result slightly differs from the correct solution, then it is possible to get also 0.5p or 1-p if the error is tiny.
- otherwise mark `-`

#### Assignments 1, 2 and 3

| **Assignment** | 1.1 | 1.2 | 1.3 | 1.4 | 2.1 | 2.2 | 2.3 | 2.4 | 3.1 | 3.2 | 3.3 | 3.4 | total  |
| :------------- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :----: |
| **Done**       |  X  |  X  |  X  |  X  |  X  |  X  |  X  |  X  |  X  |  X  |  X  |  X  | 12/12p |

#### Assignments 4, 5 and 6

| **Assignment** | 4.1 | 4.2 | 4.3 | 4.4 | 5.1 | 5.2 | 5.3 | 5.4 | 6.1 | 6.2 | 6.3(2p) | total |
| :------------- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-----: | :---: |
| **Done**       |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |    -    | 0/8p  |

Note! The teacher gives the final score, but you have to mark your own points clearly yourself.

## Weekly Exercises (max. 6p)

**Weekly exercises** (see week number like w36 == week 36, etc.).

- Mark one point (**1p**) if you complete all weekly exercises.
- If one of the weekly exercises has been completed, you can mark **0.5p**.

| **Exercises** | 01 (w36) | 02 (w37) | 03 (w38) | 04 (w39) | 05 (w40) | 06 (w41) | total  |
| :------------ | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :----: |
| **Done**      |    1p    |    1p    |   0.5p   |    -     |    -     |    -     | 2.5/6p |

It is enough that you think the weekly exercises has been completed almost correctly.
The return of weekly exercises will be checked at random during the return phase.

## Final Self-assessment (max. 2p)

| **Final Self-assessment** |
| :-----------------------: |
|             -             |

Remember to return the final self-assessment after completing the course.

## Optional Project (max. 8p)

| **Optional Project** |
| :------------------: |
|          -           |

An optional project which is evaluated by teacher.

## Example

**Note!** _This is just an example. You can remove this when you understand the idea._

| **Assignment** | 1.1 | 1.2 | 1.3 | 1.4 | 2.1 | 2.2 | 2.3 | 2.4 | total  |
| :------------- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :----: |
| **Done**       |  X  |  X  |  X  |  -  |  X  |  ?  |  X  |  X  | 6.5/8p |

Note! Now _teacher_ will evaluate 2.2.

In this example, you have successfully completed assignments 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 and nearly completed assignment 2.2.
So the total points you mark are 6.5p of 8p.
