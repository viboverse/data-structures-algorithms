# Preliminary Self-Assessment of Data Structures and Algorithms

First write a preliminary self-assessment of what you know before this course.

* **Note: Self-assessments can be written in English or in Finnish**. If you write it in Finnish, translate the self-assessment template into Finnish, but keep the numbering of the headings the same. 

Do a self-assessment of your current skills and goals in the field of data structures and algorithms **at the beginning of the course**..
Rename this Markdown document in the repository and rename it as **YourLastnameYourFirstname-SelfAssessment.md**.

> The most important thing is to be honest with yourself and strive for an objective assessment of your own skills. 
Self-reflection helps you better understand your strengths and weaknesses and can be used as a learning tool.

Consider the following points in your self-assessment:

1. Discuss the data structures and algorithms you have used, learned or developed before the course. 
   Describe how you know how to design algorithms, measure the effectiveness of algorithms or the ability to apply different data structures and algorithms.

2. Describe the projects, courses, or assignments where you have previously worked with data structures or algorithms. 
   Describe how you know different algorithms and what kind of programming experience you have.

3. Identify the topics and areas of programming where you feel the need for additional practice or understanding. 
   Think about and document what you plan to learn and improve your skills about data structures and algorithms in this course.  
   This may include mastering a particular algorithm, understanding data structures, or implementing a software project that utilizes data structures and algorithms.
