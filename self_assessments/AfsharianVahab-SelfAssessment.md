# Preliminary Self-Assessment of Data Structures and Algorithms

First write a preliminary self-assessment of what you know before this course.

- **Note: Self-assessments can be written in English or in Finnish**. If you write it in Finnish, translate the self-assessment template into Finnish, but keep the numbering of the headings the same.

Do a self-assessment of your current skills and goals in the field of data structures and algorithms **at the beginning of the course**..
Rename this Markdown document in the repository and rename it as **YourLastnameYourFirstname-SelfAssessment.md**.

> The most important thing is to be honest with yourself and strive for an objective assessment of your own skills.
> Self-reflection helps you better understand your strengths and weaknesses and can be used as a learning tool.

Consider the following points in your self-assessment:

1. Discuss the data structures and algorithms you have used, learned or developed before the course.
   Describe how you know how to design algorithms, measure the effectiveness of algorithms or the ability to apply different data structures and algorithms.

2. Describe the projects, courses, or assignments where you have previously worked with data structures or algorithms.
   Describe how you know different algorithms and what kind of programming experience you have.

3. Identify the topics and areas of programming where you feel the need for additional practice or understanding.
   Think about and document what you plan to learn and improve your skills about data structures and algorithms in this course.  
   This may include mastering a particular algorithm, understanding data structures, or implementing a software project that utilizes data structures and algorithms.

## 1. Introduction

This self-assessment reflects my current knowledge of data structures and algorithms, my strengths and weaknesses, and what I want to achieve in this course.

## 2. Skills

I have experience in JavaScript/TypeScript and React, working with arrays, objects, loops, and built-in functions like map and sort. My main strength is problem-solving, and I regularly practice by solving challenges on LeetCode for both fun and learning. Through these exercises, I have gained a basic understanding of algorithmic thinking and enjoy the process of tackling new problems.

Here is my LeetCode profile: https://leetcode.com/u/wKLrhknmtR/

However, I still lack deeper knowledge of advanced data structures and algorithm efficiency analysis, which I hope to improve during this course.

## 3. Learning

Before this course, I have learned the basics of Big O notation, arrays, recursion, and common built-in methods. I have applied these concepts in small projects like a tic-tac-toe game and todo app, but without fully understanding the algorithms behind them.

In one of my projects, I implemented the Minimax algorithm to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the computer always plays optimally and cannot be defeated. This gave me my first real experience with applying an algorithm to solve a problem.

- GitHub repo: https://github.com/viboverse/tic-tac-toe-game-app

## 4. Objectives

My goals are to learn common data structures, practice classic algorithms, analyze efficiency with Big O, and improve problem-solving skills for future projects.

## 5. Conclusion

Currently, my knowledge is basic, but I am motivated to improve. I aim to build a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures to support my future as a developer. Especailly for interviews this skills is so necceseray to have.
