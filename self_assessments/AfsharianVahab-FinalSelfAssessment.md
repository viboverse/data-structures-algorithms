# Final Self-Assessment of Data Structures and Algorithms

Your last task is to write a **final self-assessment** of what you know after this course.

* **Note: Final Self-assessments can be written in English or in Finnish**. If you write it in Finnish, translate the self-assessment template into Finnish, but keep the numbering of the headings the same.

Do a final self-assessment of your skills and goals in the field of data structures and algorithms **after the course**.
Rename this Markdown document in your repository and name it in the format **LastnameFirstname-FinalSelfAssessment.md**.  

> The most important thing is to be honest with yourself and strive for an objective assessment of your own skills. 
  Self-reflection helps you better understand your strengths and weaknesses and can be used as a learning tool.

Consider the following points in your final self-assessment:

1. Discuss the data structures and algorithms you have used, learned or developed in this course. 
   Describe how you know how to design algorithms, measure the effectiveness of algorithms or the ability to apply different data structures and algorithms.

2. Give concrete examples of successes or challenges you have faced in learning data structures and algorithms.
   Describe how you know different data structures and algorithms and what kind of new programming experience you have after the course.

3. Identify the topics and areas of programming where you feel the need for additional practice or understanding after the course. 
   Think about and document what you learned about data structures and algorithms in this course.
   Consider and document your future learning and improvement goals related to data structures and algorithms.
   Summarize your programming journey by highlighting the skills you acquired, including a general understanding of programming, skills in various data structures and algorithms, hands-on experience, or implementing a project that utilizes data structures and algorithms.
